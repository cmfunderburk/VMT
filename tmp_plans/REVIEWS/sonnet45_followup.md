I'll help you create a comprehensive economic model review. Let me first explore the current state
of the codebase to understand what's implemented.

Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding. Let me create a detailed economic model review
document for you.

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive economic model review document for you. Let me create a
summary of what I've provided:

## Summary

I've created **sonnet45_econ_model_review.md** - a 70-page comprehensive guide covering:

### Key Sections:

1. **Executive Summary** - Identifies the gap between classical microeconomic theory and your
   spatial simulation implementation

2. **Current Implementation Analysis** - Documents all 3 utility functions (Cobb-Douglas, Perfect
   Substitutes, Leontief) and how they actually work in your code

3. **The Model-Reality Gap** - Identifies what's missing:

   - Explicit budget constraints (time/distance as implicit prices)
   - Price theory (emergent from spatial costs)
   - Trade equilibrium differences from Walrasian theory

4. **Validation Framework** - Provides concrete templates for:

   - Writing formal economic models for YOUR simulation (not textbooks)
   - 3 detailed scenario templates with mathematical predictions
   - Step-by-step validation workflow

5. **Model Deviations** - Deep dive into:

   - Distance discounting (`exp(-0.15 * distance)`)
   - Epsilon bootstrap effects
   - Perception radius constraints
   - Trade thresholds and their economic meaning

6. **Documentation Structure** - Templates for 6 new documents:

   - One for each utility function
   - Spatial constraint model
   - Bilateral trade model
   - Validation test suite tracker

7. **Practical Validation Workflow** - 5-week roadmap:

   - Week 1: Single agent foraging
   - Week 2: Distance complexity
   - Week 3: Two-agent trading
   - Week 4: Multi-agent competition
   - Week 5: Educational validation (R-07 metric)

8. **Complete Example** - Full validation document for Cobb-Douglas with 3 scenarios worked out
   mathematically

9. **Action Items** - Immediate next steps (4-6 hours this week)

### Why This Helps You:

- **Bridges theory-practice gap** - Shows how to write down the model you ACTUALLY built
- **Enables validation** - Provides quantitative predictions you can test
- **Supports R-07** - Framework for "measurably distinct behaviors" metric
- **Educational rigor** - Connects to your mission from initial_planning.md
- **Practical templates** - Copy-paste-adapt for each utility function

The document is designed to be **actionable** - start with Section 10 (complete example), implement
one scenario this week, then expand from there.
