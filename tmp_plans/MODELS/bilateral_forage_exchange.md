# Bilateral Forage-and-Exchange Model

**Model Type**: Phase 2.1 - Two-Agent Forage-and-Trade System  
**Created**: October 8, 2025  
**Status**: Mathematical Specification (Pre-Implementation)  
**Purpose**: Foundation for all multi-agent economic interactions

---

## Overview

This document provides the complete mathematical and economic theory for a two-agent system where agents:
1. **Forage** for resources in spatially separated regions (specialization by proximity)
2. **Exchange** goods through bilateral negotiation (gains from trade)

This is the **critical foundation** for all multi-agent economics in VMT EconSim. The model bridges classical trade theory (comparative advantage, gains from trade, Pareto improvements) with spatial grid implementation (distance costs, perception constraints, sequential exchange).

**Educational Goal**: Demonstrate that specialization due to spatial proximity + complementary preferences → mutual gains from voluntary exchange.

## 1. Economic Setup

### 1.1 Agent Specifications

**Agent 1** (Prefers Good 2, Located Near Good 1):
- **Utility function**: $U_1(q_1, q_2) = (q_1 + \varepsilon)^{0.7} \cdot (q_2 + \varepsilon)^{0.3}$
  - $\alpha_1 = 0.7$, $\beta_1 = 0.3$ (prefers Good 1, but not strongly)
- **Home location**: $(5, 5)$ (near Resource A cluster)
- **Initial bundle**: $(0, 0)$ (starts with nothing)
- **Perception radius**: $R = 8$ Manhattan units

**Agent 2** (Prefers Good 1, Located Near Good 2):
- **Utility function**: $U_2(q_1, q_2) = (q_1 + \varepsilon)^{0.3} \cdot (q_2 + \varepsilon)^{0.7}$
  - $\alpha_2 = 0.3$, $\beta_2 = 0.7$ (prefers Good 2, but not strongly)
- **Home location**: $(15, 15)$ (near Resource B cluster)
- **Initial bundle**: $(0, 0)$ (starts with nothing)
- **Perception radius**: $R = 8$ Manhattan units

**Critical Economic Property**: **Complementary preferences** - Each agent prefers the good they are farther from, creating potential gains from trade.

### 1.2 Resource Configuration

**Good 1 (Resource A) Cluster**:
- Located near Agent 1's home $(5, 5)$
- Example positions: $(4, 4)$, $(5, 3)$, $(6, 5)$, $(4, 7)$, $(7, 6)$
- Distances from Agent 1: 1-3 Manhattan units (low foraging cost)
- Distances from Agent 2: 12-16 Manhattan units (high foraging cost)

**Good 2 (Resource B) Cluster**:
- Located near Agent 2's home $(15, 15)$
- Example positions: $(14, 14)$, $(15, 16)$, $(16, 15)$, $(14, 17)$, $(17, 14)$
- Distances from Agent 2: 1-3 Manhattan units (low foraging cost)
- Distances from Agent 1: 12-16 Manhattan units (high foraging cost)

**Spatial Separation**: $d(\text{Home}_1, \text{Home}_2) = |15-5| + |15-5| = 20$ Manhattan units

### 1.3 Economic Parameters

- **Epsilon**: $\varepsilon = 0.01$ (utility function stability parameter)
- **Distance discount**: $k = 0.15$ (exponential travel cost)
- **Carry capacity**: $C_{\max} = 10$ units per agent
- **Home storage**: Unlimited capacity
- **Exchange ratio**: 1-for-1 (Agent 1 gives 1 unit of Good 1, receives 1 unit of Good 2)

---

## 2. Foraging Phase: Specialization by Proximity

### 2.1 Agent 1's Foraging Behavior

**Economic Trade-off**:
- **Good 1 (nearby)**: Distance $d_A \approx 2$ units
  - Distance-discounted value: $MU_1^1 \cdot e^{-0.15 \cdot 2} \approx MU_1^1 \cdot 0.74$
- **Good 2 (far)**: Distance $d_B \approx 14$ units
  - Distance-discounted value: $MU_2^1 \cdot e^{-0.15 \cdot 14} \approx MU_2^1 \cdot 0.12$

**Marginal Utilities** (at bundle $(q_1, q_2)$):
$$
MU_1^1 = 0.7 \cdot \frac{U_1(q_1, q_2)}{q_1 + 0.01}
$$
$$
MU_2^1 = 0.3 \cdot \frac{U_1(q_1, q_2)}{q_2 + 0.01}
$$

**Initial Decision** (bundle $= (0, 0)$):
- $MU_1^1 = 0.7 \cdot \frac{0.01}{0.01} = 0.7$
- $MU_2^1 = 0.3 \cdot \frac{0.01}{0.01} = 0.3$
- Discounted values: $V_A = 0.7 \cdot 0.74 = 0.52$, $V_B = 0.3 \cdot 0.12 = 0.036$
- **Choice**: Collect Good 1 (14.4× higher value)

**After Collecting 10 Units of Good 1** (bundle $= (10, 0)$):
- $MU_1^1 = 0.7 \cdot \frac{U_1}{10.01} \approx 0.070$
- $MU_2^1 = 0.3 \cdot \frac{U_1}{0.01} \approx 30.0$ (very high, Good 2 scarce)
- Discounted values: $V_A = 0.070 \cdot 0.74 = 0.052$, $V_B = 30.0 \cdot 0.12 = 3.6$
- **Choice**: Now prefers Good 2 (despite 7× preference weight toward Good 1!)

**Specialization Result**: Agent 1 initially focuses on Good 1 (proximity advantage), but after accumulating ~10 units, **strongly desires Good 2** (diminishing returns + scarcity).

**Predicted Foraging Bundle** (after ~30 timesteps):
- Agent 1: $(10, 2)$ - Specializes in Good 1, collects some Good 2 at high cost
- Utility: $U_1(10, 2) = (10.01)^{0.7} \cdot (2.01)^{0.3} \approx 5.58$

### 2.2 Agent 2's Foraging Behavior

**Economic Trade-off** (symmetric to Agent 1):
- **Good 2 (nearby)**: Distance $d_B \approx 2$ units
  - Distance-discounted value: $MU_2^2 \cdot e^{-0.15 \cdot 2} \approx MU_2^2 \cdot 0.74$
- **Good 1 (far)**: Distance $d_A \approx 14$ units
  - Distance-discounted value: $MU_1^2 \cdot e^{-0.15 \cdot 14} \approx MU_1^2 \cdot 0.12$

**Marginal Utilities** (at bundle $(q_1, q_2)$):
$$
MU_1^2 = 0.3 \cdot \frac{U_2(q_1, q_2)}{q_1 + 0.01}
$$
$$
MU_2^2 = 0.7 \cdot \frac{U_2(q_1, q_2)}{q_2 + 0.01}
$$

**Specialization Result**: Agent 2 initially focuses on Good 2 (proximity advantage), then **strongly desires Good 1** (diminishing returns + scarcity).

**Predicted Foraging Bundle** (after ~30 timesteps):
- Agent 2: $(2, 10)$ - Specializes in Good 2, collects some Good 1 at high cost
- Utility: $U_2(2, 10) = (2.01)^{0.3} \cdot (10.01)^{0.7} \approx 5.58$

**Symmetry Note**: Both agents achieve similar utility levels through symmetric specialization.

### 2.3 Comparative Advantage Analysis

**Classical Trade Theory** (Ricardo, 1817):
- Agents specialize in production where they have **comparative advantage** (lower opportunity cost)
- Mutual gains from trade arise even if one agent is more efficient at everything

**Spatial Implementation**:
- **Comparative advantage** determined by **distance**, not inherent productivity
- Agent 1's opportunity cost of Good 1: $\approx 2$ distance units
- Agent 1's opportunity cost of Good 2: $\approx 14$ distance units
- **Ratio**: Agent 1 "produces" Good 1 at 1/7 the cost of Good 2 (in distance)

**Prediction**: Specialization by proximity → each agent produces the "wrong" good (opposite of preference) → gains from exchange.

---

## 3. Exchange Phase: Gains from Trade

### 3.1 Mutual Gains Exist (Pre-Trade Analysis)

**Post-Foraging Bundles**:
- Agent 1: $(10, 2)$ with $U_1 = 5.58$
- Agent 2: $(2, 10)$ with $U_2 = 5.58$

**Marginal Utility Ratios** (willingness to trade):

**Agent 1**:
$$
\frac{MU_1^1}{MU_2^1} = \frac{0.7/(10 + 0.01)}{0.3/(2 + 0.01)} = \frac{0.07}{0.149} \approx 0.47
$$
- **Interpretation**: Agent 1 willing to give up 1 unit of Good 1 for $1/0.47 \approx 2.1$ units of Good 2
- Agent 1 **values Good 2 highly** (has too much Good 1)

**Agent 2**:
$$
\frac{MU_1^2}{MU_2^2} = \frac{0.3/(2 + 0.01)}{0.7/(10 + 0.01)} = \frac{0.149}{0.07} \approx 2.13
$$
- **Interpretation**: Agent 2 willing to give up $2.13$ units of Good 2 for 1 unit of Good 1
- Agent 2 **values Good 1 highly** (has too much Good 2)

**Trade Surplus Calculation**:
- Agent 1 willing to trade: 1 Good 1 for ≥ 0.47 Good 2
- Agent 2 willing to trade: 1 Good 2 for ≥ 0.47 Good 1 (reciprocal: $1/2.13 \approx 0.47$)
- **1-for-1 exchange**: Both agents gain surplus (exchange rate between willingness bounds)

### 3.2 Pareto Improvement Calculation

**1-for-1 Trade** (Agent 1 gives 1 Good 1, receives 1 Good 2):

**Agent 1's Utility Change**:
$$
\Delta U_1 = U_1(9, 3) - U_1(10, 2)
$$
$$
= (9.01)^{0.7} \cdot (3.01)^{0.3} - (10.01)^{0.7} \cdot (2.01)^{0.3}
$$
$$
= 5.65 - 5.58 = +0.07 \quad (\text{+1.3\% utility gain})
$$

**Agent 2's Utility Change**:
$$
\Delta U_2 = U_2(3, 9) - U_2(2, 10)
$$
$$
= (3.01)^{0.3} \cdot (9.01)^{0.7} - (2.01)^{0.3} \cdot (10.01)^{0.7}
$$
$$
= 5.65 - 5.58 = +0.07 \quad (\text{+1.3\% utility gain})
$$

**Pareto Improvement**: $\Delta U_1 > 0$ AND $\Delta U_2 > 0$ ✓

**Total Welfare Gain**: $\Delta W = \Delta U_1 + \Delta U_2 = 0.14$ (2.5% increase in total utility)

### 3.3 Multiple Trades to Equilibrium

**Trade Sequence Prediction**:

| Trade # | Agent 1 Bundle | Agent 2 Bundle | $U_1$ | $U_2$ | Total Welfare |
|---------|----------------|----------------|-------|-------|---------------|
| 0       | (10, 2)        | (2, 10)        | 5.58  | 5.58  | 11.16         |
| 1       | (9, 3)         | (3, 9)         | 5.65  | 5.65  | 11.30         |
| 2       | (8, 4)         | (4, 8)         | 5.68  | 5.68  | 11.36         |
| 3       | (7, 5)         | (5, 7)         | 5.69  | 5.69  | 11.38         |
| 4       | (6, 6)         | (6, 6)         | 5.68  | 5.68  | 11.36         |

**Equilibrium Reached**: After 3 trades, bundles approach $(7, 5)$ and $(5, 7)$

**Equilibrium Condition** (MU ratios equal):
$$
\frac{MU_1^1}{MU_2^1} = \frac{MU_1^2}{MU_2^2}
$$

At bundle $(7, 5)$ for Agent 1:
$$
\frac{0.7/(7.01)}{0.3/(5.01)} = \frac{0.0998}{0.0598} \approx 1.67
$$

At bundle $(5, 7)$ for Agent 2:
$$
\frac{0.3/(5.01)}{0.7/(7.01)} = \frac{0.0598}{0.0998} \approx 0.60
$$

**Note**: Exact equilibrium not reached due to:
1. **Discrete trades**: Can only exchange integer units
2. **1-for-1 constraint**: Cannot adjust exchange ratio
3. **Over-shooting**: Trade 4 makes both agents worse off (5.68 → 5.68 is lateral)

**Optimal Stopping**: After Trade 3, further 1-for-1 exchanges reduce utility (no Pareto improvements available).

### 3.4 Equilibrium Bundle Calculation (Continuous Case)

**Theoretical Equilibrium** (if continuous exchange possible):

At equilibrium, marginal utility ratios must be equal:
$$
\frac{0.7}{q_1^1 + \varepsilon} \cdot \frac{q_2^1 + \varepsilon}{0.3} = \frac{0.3}{q_1^2 + \varepsilon} \cdot \frac{q_2^2 + \varepsilon}{0.7}
$$

With resource constraint: $q_1^1 + q_1^2 = 12$ and $q_2^1 + q_2^2 = 12$ (total available)

Solving (ignoring epsilon for simplicity):
$$
\frac{0.7 \cdot q_2^1}{0.3 \cdot q_1^1} = \frac{0.3 \cdot q_2^2}{0.7 \cdot q_1^2}
$$

$$
\frac{7 q_2^1}{3 q_1^1} = \frac{3 q_2^2}{7 q_1^2}
$$

With $q_2^1 = 12 - q_2^2$ and $q_1^1 = 12 - q_1^2$:

After algebraic manipulation (details omitted):
$$
q_1^1 \approx 7.06, \quad q_2^1 \approx 5.29
$$
$$
q_1^2 \approx 4.94, \quad q_2^2 \approx 6.71
$$

**Rounded Discrete Equilibrium**: $(7, 5)$ and $(5, 7)$ ✓

**Maximum Welfare**:
$$
W^* = U_1(7, 5) + U_2(5, 7) = 5.69 + 5.69 = 11.38
$$

**Welfare Gain from Trade**: $11.38 - 11.16 = 0.22$ (2.0% improvement over specialization alone)

---

## 4. Spatial Dynamics and Constraints

### 4.1 Perception Radius Constraint

**Agent 1 can see Agent 2 if**:
$$
d(\text{Agent}_1, \text{Agent}_2) \leq R = 8
$$

With homes at $(5, 5)$ and $(15, 15)$:
$$
d = |15-5| + |15-5| = 20 > 8 \quad \text{(NOT visible from home)}
$$

**Implication**: Agents must **move toward each other** to initiate trade.

**Meeting Point Options**:
1. **Midpoint**: $(10, 10)$ - Equal travel for both (distance = 10 each)
2. **Agent 1 travels to Agent 2**: Distance = 20
3. **Agent 2 travels to Agent 1**: Distance = 20

**Optimal Strategy**: Meet at midpoint (minimizes total travel cost)

### 4.2 Travel Cost in Trade Decision

**Distance-Adjusted Trade Value**:

For Agent 1 to initiate trade, the utility gain must exceed travel cost (in utility terms):
$$
\Delta U_1 \cdot U_1 > \text{Cost}_{\text{travel}}
$$

**Problem**: Travel cost not currently modeled in utility function. Current implementation:
- Distance discounts **marginal utility of resources** (foraging)
- Trade decisions ignore **opportunity cost of travel time**

**Theoretical Fix** (Future Enhancement):
$$
\text{Net Gain} = \Delta U_1 - k_{\text{travel}} \cdot d_{\text{travel}}
$$

where $k_{\text{travel}}$ converts distance to utility loss (e.g., 0.01 utility per unit distance).

**Example**: 
- Trade gain: $\Delta U_1 = 0.07$
- Travel cost: $10 \text{ units} \times 0.01 = 0.10$ utility
- **Net**: $0.07 - 0.10 = -0.03$ (trade not worthwhile!)

**Critical Question**: At what distance does travel cost erase gains from trade?

### 4.3 Trade Location Decision

**Three Scenarios**:

**Scenario A**: Agents trade at Agent 1's home $(5, 5)$
- Agent 1 travel: 0 units
- Agent 2 travel: 20 units
- Total travel: 20 units

**Scenario B**: Agents trade at Agent 2's home $(15, 15)$
- Agent 1 travel: 20 units
- Agent 2 travel: 0 units
- Total travel: 20 units

**Scenario C**: Agents meet at midpoint $(10, 10)$
- Agent 1 travel: 10 units
- Agent 2 travel: 10 units
- Total travel: 20 units (same total, but **distributed equally**)

**Efficiency Argument**: Scenario C is **Pareto optimal** for travel (neither agent can be made better off without making the other worse off).

**Current Implementation**: Agents move toward each other until within perception radius, then execute trade.

### 4.4 Timing: Forage First, Then Trade

**Economic Logic**:
1. **Initial state**: Both agents have $(0, 0)$ - no gains from trade (nothing to exchange)
2. **After foraging**: Agents have complementary bundles $(10, 2)$ and $(2, 10)$ - gains from trade exist
3. **After exchange**: Bundles approach equilibrium $(7, 5)$ and $(5, 7)$ - maximum welfare

**Critical Insight**: **Specialization creates gains from trade**. Without spatial separation forcing specialization, both agents would collect balanced bundles and have no reason to trade.

**Spatial Economics Lesson**: Distance → specialization → trade opportunities → welfare gains.

## 5. Theoretical Questions and Predictions

### 5.1 What is the Equilibrium Bundle for Each Agent?

**Answer**: $(7, 5)$ for Agent 1 and $(5, 7)$ for Agent 2 (discrete approximation to continuous equilibrium).

**Derivation**:
- Continuous equilibrium: $q_1^1 \approx 7.06$, $q_2^1 \approx 5.29$
- Rounded to integers: $(7, 5)$
- Verification: MU ratios closest to equality at this bundle

**Validation Test**:
```python
def test_equilibrium_bundle_convergence():
    """After sufficient trades, bundles should reach (7,5) and (5,7)"""
    # Run simulation for 100 timesteps
    # Expected: Final bundles within 1 unit of predicted equilibrium
```

### 5.2 How Many Trades Occur Before Equilibrium?

**Answer**: 3 trades (from post-foraging state to equilibrium).

**Trade Sequence**:
1. $(10, 2) \leftrightarrow (2, 10)$ → $(9, 3)$ and $(3, 9)$
2. $(9, 3) \leftrightarrow (3, 9)$ → $(8, 4)$ and $(4, 8)$
3. $(8, 4) \leftrightarrow (4, 8)$ → $(7, 5)$ and $(5, 7)$

**Validation Test**:
```python
def test_trade_count_to_equilibrium():
    """Count trades from initial bundles to equilibrium"""
    # Expected: 3 trades ± 1 (discrete vs continuous)
```

### 5.3 Does Spatial Separation Prevent Mutually Beneficial Trades?

**Answer**: Depends on **travel cost** vs **trade gain**.

**Break-Even Distance**:
$$
d_{\text{critical}} = \frac{\Delta U}{k_{\text{travel}}}
$$

**Example**:
- Trade gain: $\Delta U = 0.07$
- Travel cost coefficient: $k_{\text{travel}} = 0.01$ utility per unit
- Critical distance: $d = 0.07 / 0.01 = 7$ units

**If homes separated by > 7 units**: Travel cost > trade gain → no trade occurs.

**Current Configuration**: Homes separated by 20 units, but agents only need to travel 10 each (to midpoint).

**With midpoint meeting**: Trade occurs if $10 \times k_{\text{travel}} < \Delta U$, or $k_{\text{travel}} < 0.007$.

**Validation Test**:
```python
def test_spatial_barrier_prevents_trade():
    """Increase home separation until trade stops"""
    # Vary distance from 20 to 50 units
    # Expected: Trade ceases beyond critical distance
```

### 5.4 What Happens if Perception Radius < Distance Between Homes?

**Answer**: Agents cannot see each other from home → must explore to find partner.

**Scenarios**:

**Scenario 1**: $R = 8$, $d_{\text{homes}} = 20$
- Agents invisible to each other at home
- Must move toward center to perceive partner
- Trade possible if agents explore

**Scenario 2**: $R = 5$, $d_{\text{homes}} = 20$
- Even at midpoint $(10, 10)$, agents barely see each other
- Requires precise coordination

**Scenario 3**: $R = 4$, $d_{\text{homes}} = 20$
- Agents must be within 4 units to perceive
- Unlikely to find each other without search algorithm

**Economic Implication**: **Information constraint** (limited perception) can prevent welfare-improving trades even when gains exist.

**Validation Test**:
```python
def test_perception_radius_trade_visibility():
    """Reduce perception radius until trade discovery fails"""
    # Vary R from 8 to 2
    # Expected: Trade discovery fails below critical R ≈ 5
```

### 5.5 How Do Distance Costs Affect Comparative Advantage?

**Answer**: Distance **creates** comparative advantage in this spatial model.

**Classical Trade Theory** (Ricardo):
- Comparative advantage from differential **productivity**
- Example: Agent 1 produces Good 1 faster than Agent 2

**Spatial Trade Theory** (von Thünen):
- Comparative advantage from differential **location**
- Example: Agent 1 located nearer to Good 1 resources

**VMT EconSim Implementation**:
- No productivity differences (all agents collect 1 unit per timestep)
- **Distance = sole source of comparative advantage**
- Agent 1's "productivity" in Good 1: $1 / (2 + d) \approx 0.33$ units per timestep (including travel)
- Agent 1's "productivity" in Good 2: $1 / (14 + d) \approx 0.063$ units per timestep
- **Productivity ratio**: Agent 1 is 5.2× more "productive" at Good 1 than Good 2 (due to distance)

**Prediction**: As distance costs increase (higher $k$), specialization becomes stronger → larger initial trade gains.

**Validation Test**:
```python
def test_distance_cost_specialization():
    """Increase distance discount k, verify stronger specialization"""
    # Vary k from 0.1 to 0.3
    # Expected: Higher k → more skewed bundles (e.g., (12,1) instead of (10,2))
```

## 6. Analytical Predictions for Validation

### 6.1 Test Case: Complementary Preferences Lead to Trade

**Setup**:
```python
# Agent configuration
agent_1 = Agent(
    position=(5, 5),
    utility_function=CobbDouglas(alpha=0.7, beta=0.3),
    initial_bundle=(10, 2)
)
agent_2 = Agent(
    position=(15, 15),
    utility_function=CobbDouglas(alpha=0.3, beta=0.7),
    initial_bundle=(2, 10)
)

# No resources (pure exchange scenario for simplicity)
# Agents can perceive each other (R = 8, initial distance = 20)
```

**Analytical Prediction**:
1. **Trade detection**: Both agents identify Pareto improvement (1-for-1 exchange)
2. **Movement**: Agents move toward each other to meet perception constraint
3. **Trade execution**: At least 1 trade occurs
4. **Utility verification**: $U_1(t+1) > U_1(t)$ AND $U_2(t+1) > U_2(t)$

**Success Criterion**: At least 1 trade executed, both agents' utilities increase.

### 6.2 Test Case: Trade Increases Total Utility

**Setup**: Same as Test 6.1

**Analytical Prediction**:
$$
W(t+1) = U_1(t+1) + U_2(t+1) > U_1(t) + U_2(t) = W(t)
$$

**Calculation**:
- Pre-trade: $W(0) = 5.58 + 5.58 = 11.16$
- Post-trade 1: $W(1) = 5.65 + 5.65 = 11.30$
- **Gain**: $\Delta W = 0.14$ (+1.25%)

**Success Criterion**: Total welfare increases after every Pareto-improving trade.

### 6.3 Test Case: Equilibrium Convergence

**Setup**: Same as Test 6.1, run for 20 trades or until no more trades occur

**Analytical Prediction**:
1. **Trade sequence**: $(10,2) \to (9,3) \to (8,4) \to (7,5)$ for Agent 1
2. **MU ratio convergence**: $|MU_1^1/MU_2^1 - MU_1^2/MU_2^2| < 0.1$ at equilibrium
3. **Trade cessation**: No trades occur after equilibrium reached (Trade 4 rejected)

**Numerical Check**:
- At $(7, 5)$: Agent 1's $MU_1/MU_2 = 1.67$
- At $(5, 7)$: Agent 2's $MU_1/MU_2 = 0.60$
- **Not equal**, but 1-for-1 exchange makes both worse off (verified by utility calculation)

**Success Criterion**: 
- Bundles reach $(7, 5)$ and $(5, 7)$ within ±1 unit
- No additional trades after reaching this state

### 6.4 Test Case: Spatial Barrier Prevents Trade

**Setup**:
```python
# Increase home separation
agent_1.home = (5, 5)
agent_2.home = (50, 50)  # Distance = 90 units

# Same bundles and utility functions
agent_1.bundle = (10, 2)
agent_2.bundle = (2, 10)
```

**Analytical Prediction**:
- **Perception constraint**: Agents never see each other (even at midpoint, distance = 45 > R = 8)
- **Trade opportunity**: Still exists (Pareto improvement available)
- **Trade execution**: Does not occur (cannot find partner)

**Alternate Test** (with travel cost):
- Assume travel cost: $k_{\text{travel}} = 0.005$ utility per unit
- Travel to midpoint: $d = 45$ units
- Travel cost: $45 \times 0.005 = 0.225$ utility
- Trade gain: $\Delta U = 0.07$ utility
- **Net gain**: $0.07 - 0.225 = -0.155$ (negative!)

**Success Criterion**: No trades occur when distance > perception radius OR travel cost > trade gain.

### 6.5 Test Case: Foraging Precedes Exchange

**Setup**:
```python
# Agents start with empty bundles
agent_1.bundle = (0, 0)
agent_2.bundle = (0, 0)

# Resources available (foraging enabled)
resources_A_near_agent_1 = [(4,4), (5,3), (6,5)]
resources_B_near_agent_2 = [(14,14), (15,16), (16,15)]
```

**Analytical Prediction**:

**Phase 1: Foraging** (timesteps 0-30)
- Agent 1 collects primarily Good 1 (proximity)
- Agent 2 collects primarily Good 2 (proximity)
- Bundle evolution: $(0,0) \to (1,0) \to (2,0) \to \ldots \to (10,0) \to (10,1) \to (10,2)$

**Phase 2: Exchange** (timesteps 31-40)
- Agents have complementary bundles
- Multiple trades occur
- Bundles converge to equilibrium

**Success Criterion**:
- No trades occur before agents accumulate goods (timesteps 0-20)
- Trades begin after bundles reach ~$(10, 2)$ and $(2, 10)$
- Final bundles near $(7, 5)$ and $(5, 7)$

## 7. Implementation Considerations (Future Work)

### 7.1 Trade Decision Logic with Pareto Check

**Current Gap**: Trade decision may not verify Pareto improvement.

**Required Logic**:
```python
def should_trade(agent_1, agent_2, good_offered_1, good_offered_2, amount):
    """Check if trade creates Pareto improvement"""
    # Pre-trade utilities
    u1_before = agent_1.utility_function.value(agent_1.bundle)
    u2_before = agent_2.utility_function.value(agent_2.bundle)
    
    # Simulate trade
    bundle_1_after = (agent_1.bundle[0] - amount, agent_1.bundle[1] + amount)
    bundle_2_after = (agent_2.bundle[0] + amount, agent_2.bundle[1] - amount)
    
    # Post-trade utilities
    u1_after = agent_1.utility_function.value(bundle_1_after)
    u2_after = agent_2.utility_function.value(bundle_2_after)
    
    # Pareto improvement check
    return (u1_after > u1_before) and (u2_after > u2_before)
```

**Location**: `src/econsim/simulation/agent/unified_decision.py` (trade mode)

### 7.2 Distance-Adjusted Trade Valuation

**Current Gap**: Travel cost not incorporated into trade decision.

**Required Enhancement**:
```python
def trade_net_benefit(agent, partner, trade_gain, distance_to_partner):
    """Calculate net benefit of trade including travel cost"""
    travel_cost_utility = distance_to_partner * TRAVEL_COST_COEFFICIENT
    net_gain = trade_gain - travel_cost_utility
    return net_gain

# Decision rule
if trade_net_benefit(agent, partner, delta_U, distance) > 0:
    initiate_trade()
```

**Parameter**: `TRAVEL_COST_COEFFICIENT` (new constant, requires calibration)

### 7.3 Multiple-Trade Convergence

**Current Gap**: Agents may only execute one trade, not iterating to equilibrium.

**Required Behavior**:
- After trade execution, re-evaluate bundles
- Check for additional Pareto improvements
- Continue trading until no beneficial trades remain
- Limit: Max trades per timestep (e.g., 1) to maintain temporal realism

**Test**: Verify that agents perform multiple trades across timesteps until equilibrium.

### 7.4 Meeting Point Coordination

**Current Behavior**: Agents move toward each other, but coordination may be implicit.

**Enhancement Options**:
1. **Explicit meeting point**: Midpoint calculation, both agents pathfind to same location
2. **One agent travels**: Agent with higher trade gain travels to partner
3. **Negotiated location**: Trade location selected to equalize net benefits

**Economic Theory**: Meeting point should minimize total travel cost (midpoint) OR equalize travel costs between agents (may not be midpoint if trade gains differ).

## 8. Extensions and Open Questions

### 8.1 Variable Exchange Ratios (Phase 2.3 Preview)

**Current**: 1-for-1 exchange only

**Future**: Ratio determined by marginal utility ratios
$$
\text{Exchange Ratio} = \frac{\Delta q_2}{\Delta q_1} = \frac{MU_1}{MU_2}
$$

**Example**: 
- Agent 1's $MU_1/MU_2 = 0.47$
- Agent 2's $MU_1/MU_2 = 2.13$
- **Geometric mean**: $\sqrt{0.47 \times 2.13} \approx 1.0$ (suggests 1-for-1 is reasonable)

**Question**: Does optimal ratio = geometric mean of MU ratios? Or arithmetic mean? Requires theoretical analysis.

### 8.2 Multiple Resource Types (3+ Goods)

**Current**: 2 goods only (Good 1, Good 2)

**Future**: $N$ goods with Cobb-Douglas:
$$
U(q_1, \ldots, q_N) = \prod_{i=1}^{N} (q_i + \varepsilon)^{\alpha_i}, \quad \sum_{i=1}^{N} \alpha_i = 1
$$

**Challenge**: Bilateral exchange becomes complex (which goods to trade?)

**Solution**: Agents identify most imbalanced MU ratios, propose multi-good exchanges.

### 8.3 Dynamic Resource Respawn

**Current**: Static resource distribution (post-foraging state fixed)

**Future**: Resources respawn at fixed rate (e.g., 1 unit per 10 timesteps per location)

**Economic Implication**: 
- Continuous production economy (not just exchange economy)
- Trade patterns may change as resource availability changes
- Long-run equilibrium with ongoing foraging + trading

### 8.4 Agent Population > 2

**Current**: 2 agents only

**Future**: $N$ agents with heterogeneous preferences

**Challenge**: Who trades with whom? (Matching problem)

**Options**:
1. **Bilateral sequential**: Agents pair up, trade, then find new partners
2. **Market mechanism**: Centralized price system (Phase 3)
3. **Network formation**: Agents form trading relationships based on proximity + preference compatibility

### 8.5 Transaction Costs Beyond Distance

**Current**: Only distance cost (implicit)

**Future**:
- **Information cost**: Finding trading partners (search cost)
- **Negotiation cost**: Determining exchange ratio (bargaining cost)
- **Execution cost**: Physical exchange (handling cost)

**Modeling**: Each cost as additional term in net benefit calculation.

## 9. Key Assumptions and Limitations

### 9.1 Assumptions

1. **Perfect information**: Agents know each other's bundles (within perception radius)
2. **Costless exchange**: No loss of goods during trade (no "friction")
3. **Discrete goods**: Integer units only (no continuous quantities)
4. **Sequential trades**: One trade at a time, no simultaneous multi-party exchanges
5. **1-for-1 ratio**: Fixed exchange rate (generalizes in Phase 2.3)
6. **No storage costs**: Home inventory has zero cost to maintain
7. **Unlimited storage**: Agents can accumulate arbitrary quantities at home
8. **No strategic behavior**: Agents do not withhold goods to manipulate prices
9. **Myopic optimization**: Agents maximize immediate utility gain, not long-run welfare

### 9.2 Limitations

1. **Discrete equilibrium**: Cannot reach exact continuous equilibrium (rounding effects)
2. **Integer constraints**: Some Pareto improvements may be unreachable (e.g., 0.5-for-1 trade)
3. **Travel cost omitted**: Current implementation ignores opportunity cost of movement
4. **Perception radius**: Information constraint may prevent welfare-improving trades
5. **Two goods only**: Insights may not generalize to multi-good economies
6. **Homogeneous goods**: No quality differentiation within good types
7. **Cobb-Douglas only**: Other utility functions may exhibit different trade dynamics

### 9.3 Sensitivity Analysis Required

**Parameters to vary**:
- $\alpha_1, \beta_1$ (Agent 1's preferences): Range [0.1, 0.9]
- $\alpha_2, \beta_2$ (Agent 2's preferences): Range [0.1, 0.9]
- $d_{\text{homes}}$ (home separation): Range [10, 50]
- $k$ (distance discount): Range [0.05, 0.30]
- $R$ (perception radius): Range [4, 20]
- Initial bundles: Vary from $(12, 0)$ to $(6, 6)$

**Expected Findings**:
- Larger preference differences → more trades to equilibrium
- Greater home separation → fewer trades (travel cost barrier)
- Higher $k$ → stronger specialization → larger trade gains
- Smaller $R$ → harder to find partners → fewer trades

## 12. Summary: Key Economic Insights

### 12.1 Gains from Trade Arise from Three Sources

1. **Spatial specialization**: Distance costs force production patterns
2. **Diminishing marginal utility**: Each agent values their abundant good less
3. **Complementary preferences**: Each agent prefers the other's abundant good

### 12.2 Equilibrium Properties

- **Discrete equilibrium**: $(7, 5)$ and $(5, 7)$ for baseline scenario
- **Welfare gain**: +2.0% over autarky (specialization without trade)
- **Trade count**: 3 exchanges to reach equilibrium
- **Convergence**: Guaranteed if Pareto improvements detected correctly

### 12.3 Spatial Constraints Matter

- **Perception radius**: Too small → agents can't find partners
- **Home separation**: Too large → travel cost > trade gain
- **Resource clustering**: Creates comparative advantage → enables trade

### 12.4 Educational Takeaway

**"Specialization + Exchange > Autarky"**

Students should observe:
1. Agents initially collect nearby resources (not preferred goods)
2. Complementary bundles emerge from spatial constraints
3. Voluntary exchange makes both agents better off
4. Multiple trades lead to balanced consumption
5. Equilibrium = no further mutually beneficial trades
