"""Economic Agent â€“ Unified Decision Engine Integration.

Canonical agent implementation used by the unified decision engine. Legacy
component-based architecture has been removed; this is the single agent
implementation with no backward-compatibility shims.

Key properties:
- Utility function (pluggable via factory) governs economic behavior
- Dual inventory (carrying + home) with total-bundle utility evaluation
- Deterministic state (no hidden dynamic components)
