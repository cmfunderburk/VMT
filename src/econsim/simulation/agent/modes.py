"""Agent mode management utilities for observer integration.

Provides centralized agent mode change functionality that ensures
all mode transitions go through the observer system for consistent
event emission and logging.

Design Principles:
- Single point of truth for mode changes
- Consistent observer event emission
- Backward compatibility with direct assignments
- Structured logging integration
